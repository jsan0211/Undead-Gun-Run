# Undead Gun Run (Browser Version)

This project is a browser-based multiplayer zombie shooter game rebuilt in JavaScript. It is a rewrite of the original Python + Pygame prototype (preserved in the `/legacy/` folder). The new version uses HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript for the frontend, and will eventually support multiplayer through a Node.js + Socket.IO backend.
